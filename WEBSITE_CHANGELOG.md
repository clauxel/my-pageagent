# Website Changelog

## 2026-06-03 - Standalone SEO worker repair

- Updated Worker asset lookup to avoid directory-index redirect loops for sitemap URLs.
- Removed checkout from dynamic sitemap output while keeping checkout pages available for users.
- Expanded the Worker SEO allowlist to include sitemap-listed keyword landing pages where applicable.

## 2026-06-08 16:06:51 CST - SEO/GEO + Build Checklist Repair

Scope: repaired P0/P1 checklist issues for pageagent.space.

Touched files:
  - pageagent/dist/index.html
  - pageagent/dist/pricing/index.html
  - pageagent/dist/robots.txt

Verification: ran the shared SEO/GEO patrol fixer from the latest all-sites checklist input; 9router build also passed after shared route guard changes.

Deploy/Git status: pending commit, push, deploy, and post-deploy checklist rerun.

Follow-ups: re-run the all-sites SEO/GEO + build checklist after production deployment and keep any DNS/account-only blockers in the issue ledger.

## 2026-07-01 - MiroFish contextual reference

- Added one contextual related-resource link to MiroFish AI Simulator with UTM tracking for pageagent.space.
- Placement rule: secondary Resources/Source context when available, otherwise the homepage tail; no hero, nav, pricing, checkout, or primary CTA links were changed.
- SEO safety: brand anchor only, one link per canonical site surface, visible editorial context, and no keyword-stuffed footer/sitewide block.
- Verification pending: run the site build/deploy workflow and live link checks after all portfolio edits are applied.
